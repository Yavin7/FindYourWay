Find Your Way provides several compasses to structures generated by Minecraft.

Current compasses include:
- Ender Compass
- Fortress Compass
- Mansion Compass
- Monument Compass
- Village Compass

The compasses automatically point to the nearest structure for the world you are in, and always point forwards if the structure does not exist in your world. You can right-click to re-scan for new structures, such as new Villages.

The Stronghold Compass points to the same location as Ender Eyes, so you still need to explore the actual stronghold to find the End Portal.
